# Uses primary_co2_emission attribute to set demand as the emission factor of
# coal gas depends on the amount of coal/cokes used to produce it. This can differ
# between countries/datasets
# Unfortunately this is not perfect as industry_steel_electricfurnace_burner_network_gas
# also has a network_gas input. The greengas share of network_gas has a
# primary_co2_emission of zero, so this bio CO2 does not appear in this node
# even though in reality it can be captured

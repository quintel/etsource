# Hydrogen is not final demand as it is used to produce kerosene. This node is in the
# co2_emissions_primary group. The reason for this is that kerosene demand is in the
# co2_emissions_refinery_products group, i.e. only on-the-spot emissions are accounted for.
# Inclusion in the co2_emissions_primary ensures that production emissions of synthetic
# kerosene are not omitted.

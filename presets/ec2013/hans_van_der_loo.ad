    <span class='nl'><h2>A well-educated population is the greatest asset a 
    nation can have</h2>
    <p><strong>What do you see as the main challenge for the EU and/or the 
    Netherlands specific with regards to Energy Consciousness?</strong></p>
    <p>It is important that people learn to understand the consequences of their 
    energy use: ‘a well-educated population is the greatest asset a nation can 
    have’. We could create a more robust CO2 price to make it more attractive
    to save energy. It is also important to understand the different roles of 
    science, government and business. Science is responsible for establishing 
    the situation we are in, what are the planetary limits of the holoceum (the 
    set of conditions that make life as we know it possible), the understanding 
    of how quickly we are depleting our CO2 budget to stay within 2 degrees 
    celsius climate change (2034).</p>
    <p>Governments determine WHAT needs to be done, has to set the framework
    conditions for action and has to establish the enabling conditions for an 
    energy transition. This comprises both infrastructures e.g. to cope with 
    strongly varying decentralised input of renewables. But they also need to 
    ensure that enough of our most precious resource (talent) is available to 
    meet our most pressing challenges (sustainable future & competitive 
    Europe). Industry should determine HOW the targets are most effectively 
    and efficiently achieved. Increasingly these three need to work together. 
    Jet-Net is a best practice of how these partners can successfully team up. 
    This should not just be stimulated in the Netherlands, but in Europe as a 
    whole. We should use our most precious resources on our most precious 
    challenges!</p>
    <p><strong>What is the most important issue with regards to System 
    Integration for the EU and/or the Netherlands and what should be 
    done about it?</strong></p>
    <p>To realize its goals, the EU should work as a union not only on paper, but 
    practically as well. The enabling conditions for innovation should be 
    stimulated, but also the capacity for innovation through education and 
    research. With regards to the physical system, the biggest issue results 
    from the changing of the merit order to a renewables-based system. This 
    results in decentralized and more volatile generation of energy and a 
    major increase in energy flow over our networks. We have to think and 
    operate on a European level rather than focusing on national targets. A 
    bigger playing field gives you more degrees of freedom and more scope 
    for optimization. With regards to policy, I think that governments should 
    play a modest role. They should only indicate on which high level targets 
    to focus, not on which technologies to use. Otherwise we might get stuck 
    with a technology when better ones are becoming available and thus miss 
    the goal or the cost efficiency of reaching it.</p>
    <p><strong>If you could spend 100 billion euro in the EU next year on the 
    followings subjects, how would you spend them?</strong></p>
    <p>Investing in energy saving has top priority, because it is a no-regret 
    investment. A sustainable future will not be possible without addressing 
    the demand side – as well as the supply side. After that, we should invest 
    in more efficient energy markets (e.g. infrastructure). We should not forget
    the importance of investing in education and communication to increase 
    our innovation capacity and societal acceptance of innovations. A 
    successful energy future depends on local and political support and our 
    own “cope-ability” to deal with the required change that is needed the 
    exponential era we are currently in, but so little understands. Albert 
    Bartlett was right when he said “The greatest shortcoming of the human race is its 
    inability to understand the exponential function”. We are training our youngsters for jobs that 
    do not yet exist to deal with problems were are not even aware of. Hence the importance of 
    education can not be underestimated.</p>
    <p><strong>What role can the Energy Transition Model play with regards to 
    Energy Consciousness and System Integration?</strong></p>
    <p>The model shows the cause and effects relations. Not every measure has 
    the same effect. The merit order is an important aspect to teach, 
    especially to experts in politics and media. Thus it contributes to much 
    needed systemic understanding of an important sphere of society.
    Media have a role to play as well. They should be able to state in clear 
    language the no-regret options we have, to raise acceptance and support 
    for implementing innovations we hopefully achieve by investing in 
    communication and education.</p>
    <p>Hopefully it will result in more innovations and – as important – a greater 
    societal acceptance for the implementation of these innovations. Too often
    good ideas strand because of NYMBY/NUMBY amongst the general public 
    or NIMTO (Not In My Term of Office) amongst politicians
    As Winston Churchil said: A well-educated population is the greatest asset 
    a nation can have. That goes for politicians as well. Beware of those that 
    want to cut on education!</p></span>

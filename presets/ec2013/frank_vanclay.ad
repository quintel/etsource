    <span class='nl'><h2>A social licence to operate.</h2>
    <p>People are sceptical, so both policy as well as social incentives are 
    necessary to realize goals. Changes in infrastructure, let alone 
    technological innovations will not be implemented without social 
    support. Besides policy, a social license to operate is essential. 
    Technological discussions should go hand in hand with social ones 
    through for example Constructive Technology Assessment.</p>
    <p><strong>What do you see as the main challenge for the EU and/or the
    Netherlands specific with regards to Energy Consciousness?</strong></p>
    <p>The main challenge is to get people to take it seriously. I think 
    people are sceptical and won’t change their behavior that much 
    themselves; we need technological and policy changes to change 
    the outcome. Things change when we mandate all diesels to be sold
    as a 50/50 mix with biodiesel, but it wouldn’t happen if you would 
    offer the customer both options. Governments are not singular 
    entities, however, especially at the European level it’s a delicate 
    balance.</p>
    <p><strong>What is the most important issue with regards to System 
    Integration for the EU and/or the Netherlands and what 
    should be done about it?</strong></p>
    <p>Again, it’s mostly a policy consideration with a focus on social 
    issues. There will be plenty of technological issues, but I think in the 
    timeframe that we are talking about (2030) these will be addressed. 
    The electricity grid in Europe is going to be integrated completely in 
    the future, which means that many of the cables are routed wrong. 
    But new infrastructures are often opposed on a local level, so we 
    must address social issues too. The same goes for wind farms: 
    locally people are against putting them up. The energy sector has to
    realize they need to gain acceptance from local communities, a 
    social license to operate.</p>
    <p><strong>If you could spend 100 billion euro in the EU next year on 
    the followings subjects, how would you spend them?</strong></p>
    <p>We should not spend all the money on technical research. A social 
    commitment is essential for technological implementation. A 
    concept called Constructive Technology Assessment makes 
    technological discussions go hand in hand with public discussions 
    about social issues. Money would have to be allocated to solving 
    these kinds of issues so technological innovation won’t die on the 
    shelf.</p>
    <p><strong>What role can the Energy Transition Model play with regards
    to Energy Consciousness and System Integration?</strong></p>
    <p>Potentially, models are training tools or teaching mechanisms that 
    create a way of thinking. The ETM in that way can play a role in 
    developing energy knowledge and consciousness.</p></span>

# chemical crude oil non energetic demand is determined by fertilizers non-energetic oil demand and by 'locally available' crude oil non energetic
# locally available oil depends on how large the refinery sector is in a region
# if the refinery sector produces more non energetic oil than the demand of the chemical other sector the surplus gets exported (energy_export_oil_products)
# if the refinery sector produces less non energetic oil than the demand of the chemical other sector the deficit is imported (that is, the deficit is passed on to 'industry_final_demand_for_chemical_crude_oil_non_energetic' -> 'industry_final_demand_crude_oil_non_energetic' -> 'energy_distribution_crude_oil' and eventually imported)
# if the refinery sector produces more than the demand of the chemical other sector, 'industry_final_demand_for_chemical_crude_oil_non_energetic' can be 0 (if fertilizers crude oil demand is 0 as well), while 'industry_final_demand_for_chemical_other_crude_oil_non_energetic' is NOT zero. In other words, 'industry_final_demand_for_chemical_crude_oil_non_energetic' is not simply the sum of the demands of chemical fertilizers, refineries and chemical other

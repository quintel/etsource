# The default setting for solar heaters for hot water is that they can produce
# max 50% of the total useful demand of hot water. For Cyprus this doesn't work 
# since 75% of the final demand for hot water is delivered by solar thermal, this
# this is 17% of the total final demand for households. Therefore, we set the threshold
# on 15% and in that case all hot water can be delivered with solar thermal.

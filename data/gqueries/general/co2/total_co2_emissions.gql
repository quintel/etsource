# Total co2 emission of this graph.

# Take note: The imported electricity is not included in co2_emissions_of_final_demand_excluding_imported_electricity therefore the CO2_emissions_of_imported_electricity are added here.#

# MECE groups have the same total_co2_emissions, with the exception of primary_demand:
# 
# We exclude the energy coming from non-energetic use converters. As they
# are left of the primary energy demand and therefore not subtracted when 
# calculating the total_co2_emission of primary_demand
# 
# final_demand.primary_co2_emission == useful_demand.primary_co2_emission != primary_demand.primary_co2_emission

# definition of input_of_fossil_carriers is now as follows:
#     input_of_coal + input_of_crude_oil + input_of_natural_gas + input_of_diesel + input_of_gasoline + input_of_steam_hot_water + input_of_gas_power_fuelmix
# This is important for the correct workings of this query
#
# the green gas is deducted.

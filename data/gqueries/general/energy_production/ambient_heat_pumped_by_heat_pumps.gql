# The total use of all ambient heat in the model 'left' of final demand.
# 
# Here, we should build something that calculates the ambient heat that is used only 'left' of the final demand for the renewability calculation, so the ambient heat is not counted double.
# 
# This dynamic solution is not possible yet, but should be fixed when it is.

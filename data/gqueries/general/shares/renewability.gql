# The final demand that is filled by sustainable sources is divided over the total final energy demand.
# This is only calculated over the energetic final demand.
#
# Also, the ambient heat that is used is added to the final demand.
# Here, it is important to notice that the ambient heat that is used should be calculated only 'left' of the final demand,
# otherwise the ambient heat is counted double. This is not possible yet, but should be fixed when it is.

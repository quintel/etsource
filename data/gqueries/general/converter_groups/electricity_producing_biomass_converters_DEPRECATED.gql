# Returns the converters which produce electricity using biomoass. It works by looking to converters directly fed by the "energy_distribution_bio_residues_for_firing" converter that have output of electricity.

- unit = converters
- deprecated_key = electricity_producing_biomass_converters

FILTER(
  PARENTS(V(energy_distribution_bio_residues_for_firing )),
  "electricity_output_conversion && electricity_output_conversion > 0"

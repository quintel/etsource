# Required new MV/LV transformer capacity during a winter evening.
# Query takes into account all technologies attached below MV/LV tranformer level (i.e. at the LV-network level)
# Query sums the newly required capacities per technology (peak_laod_in_mw) and adds these to the currently used capacity on the network (network_capacity_used_in_mw)

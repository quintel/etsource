# Costs for O&M of the HV-net.
# Note: Since the HV-net uses a different calculation than other voltage levels this query is slightly different.
# Here it is assumed that all electricity in the HV network passes through the HV/MV network, therefore the costs scale with HV/MV newly required capacity

# Calculates the network costs for offshore wind turbines
# For the first 3000 turbines there is room on the network and no additional costs are made
# Above this value the costs are estimated at 400 EUR/kW which is 1.2 MEur/turbine.
# This is slightly lower than the range of the values used by CE Delft and D-Cision in the NET-document (466,7  and 800 EUR/kW respectively). 
# The reason for is because network costs of offshore wind turbines are already partially counted with the other central production technologies on the HV-network
# See Q(hv_net_delta_capacity_central)

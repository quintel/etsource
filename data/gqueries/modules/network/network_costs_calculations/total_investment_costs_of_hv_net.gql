# Total investment costs for the HV-network. Here a few rules of thumb are used given to us by TenneT:
# There is 1600MW room on the HV-network before expansion is required (see Q(hv_net_capacity_buffer_total_check))
# Above this amount the investment costs are, in MEur, 20% of the installed capacity, in MW. (for example: 2000MW = 400MEur)
# However if the newly installed decentral capacity is above 30GW (see Q(hv_net_capacity_buffer_decentral_check)) the 20% increases to 25% for the decentral capacity
# Finally, also the costs of the 'stopcontact op zee' of offshore wind turbines is added

# Score calculated for etflex.
# The basis of the score is 1000, minus 5.0 times the costs in billions, minus the CO2 emissions in Mton,
# plus 2x the percentage renewability of the scenario, minus 5x the number of nuclear power plants (because of nuclear waste).
# plus 2x the percentage of maximum attainable renewability (free points!). This reduces the (negative) infuence of the renewability fraction. 
# - (0.02 points for each percentage of LEDs or solar heater)^2
# - (0.03 points for each percentage of electric car or heatpump)^2
# - (0.4 points for each percentage point of green gas)^2
# - ((absolute difference between production and demand of electricity)^2)/500.

# The result is multiplied by a factor:
# - the reliability of the electricity production squared,

- unit = #

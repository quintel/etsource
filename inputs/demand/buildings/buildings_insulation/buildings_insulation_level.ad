# This query:
# - calculates the share of the useful heat demand that is saved with insulation based on the difference between start and future reduction and updates the graph
# - updates the insulation costs query
# NOTE: lowering the insulation level has no consequences
# NOTE: the buildings heat demand profile doesn't depend on the insulation level, since we have no good source for these profiles

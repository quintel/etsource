# x represents the share of local ammonia production (through Haber-Bosch) with local hydrogen production (through steam methane reforming) in the total ammonia demand for fertilizer production
# y represents the share of local ammonia production (through Haber_Bosch) with central hydrogen (from the network) in the total ammonia demand for fertilizer production

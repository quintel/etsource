# This input:
# - calculates the total future demand through changes in insulation and construction
# - updates the demand using the total future demand
# - updates the number of detached_houses_future
# - updates the insulation costs
# - updates the number of units of P2P based on the total number of residences
# - updates the number of residences for hot water demand
# - the roof surface available for solar PV on houses based on the changed total number of residences
# - the total useful demand for cooling based on the changed total number of residences
# - the electricity production of households solar PV, because user sets a share of the potential
# Typical surface area per buildings is based on nl2019 value for detached houses from 2005 to present

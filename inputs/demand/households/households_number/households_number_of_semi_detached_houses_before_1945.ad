# This input:
# - calculates the relative decrease in demand through insulation
# - calculates the relative decrease in demand through demolition
# - updates the demand using the combined relative change in demand
# - updates the number of semi_detached_houses_before_1945
# - updates the insulation costs
# - updates the number of units of P2P based on the total number of residences
# - updates the number of residences for hot water demand
# - the roof surface available for solar PV on houses based on the changed total number of residences
# - the total useful demand for cooling based on the changed total number of residences
# - the electricity production of households solar PV, because user sets a share of the potential

# Defines which curves end-users are allowed to upload via ETModel.
#
# Every curve must define a key and a type.
#
# key  - A unique identifier for the curve. Normally this should match the
#        name of a curve in the ETSource datasets, as you might specify them
#        to the "merit_order.group" attribute. For example:
#        "buildings_cooling", "weather/solar_thermal".
#
# type - Tells ETEngine how to process the uploaded curve.
#
# #### Types
#
# `type: generic`
#
#   ETEngine will convert the uploaded file into a curve of 8760 numeric values,
#   after asserting that the user curve _has_ 8760 values and that each value is
#   numeric.
#
# `type: price`
#
#   ETEngine will treat this as a price curve. The behaviour is the same as the
#   "generic" type, except that each value is rounded to two decimal places.
#
# `type: profile`
#
#   The uploaded curve is a profile. The values in the original curve are used
#   to generate a profile such that the sum of the curve is 1 / 3600 (i.e., the
#   shape of the user curve is retained, and useable as a demand profile, but
#   the specific values are not).
#
# #### Setting an input
#
# Uploaded curves may be "reduced" to a single numeric value, with that value
# then used to set one or more inputs in the user scenario. For example,
# uploading a profile for a technology may require setting an input value to
# assign a full_load_hours value which matches the curve.
#
# This is done with an optional "reduce" object containing "as" and "sets" keys.
#
# reduce.as   - Tells ETEngine how to reduce the curve to a numeric. Valid
#               values are "full_load_hours" and "temperature".
#
# reduce.sets - Either a string or array of strings containing input keys whose
#               values should be set.
#
# #### Examples
#
# # Configures an interconnector price curve.
#
# interconnector_1_price:
#   type: price
#
# # Configures a profile for the offshore wind. Sets a single input.
#
# offshore_wind:
#   type: profile
#   reduce:
#     as: full_load_hours
#     sets: flh_of_energy_power_wind_turbine_offshore
#
# # Configures a profile for a (hypothetical) heating technology. Sets three
# # inputs.

#     as: full_load_hours
#     sets:

#       - flh_of_technology_3

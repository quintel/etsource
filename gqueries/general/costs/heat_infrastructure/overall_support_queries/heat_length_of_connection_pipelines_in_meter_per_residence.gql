# This query calculates the average length of the connection
# pipelines per connected residence. This length depends on the share of residences
# connected to the network. The more objects are connected to the network, the
# higher the average pipeline length per connection. This is calculated by
# distinguishing different length brackets
# See https://github.com/quintel/documentation/blob/master/general/heat_infrastructure_costs.md

# Final demand of non-biogenic oil and derivatives in industry (energetic use)
#
# This query uses a different approach than other sectors because naphtha is
# modeled separately in the industry sector:
# 1. Takes the demand from industry_final_demand_crude_oil and multiplies it
#    by the non-biogenic share (which covers diesel, kerosene, lpg, and crude_oil)
# 2. Adds the full demand from industry_final_demand_naphtha (which is already
#    fully non-biogenic)

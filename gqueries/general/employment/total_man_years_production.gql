# The total man-year spent in NL on production.
# Originally this was (analogous to the other queries):
#PRODUCT(
#	DIVIDE(
#		PRODUCT(
#			SUM(
#				V(Q(employment_converters);hours_prod_nl*number_of_units/technical_lifetime)),
#				V(Q(scenario_duration)
#			)
#		),
#		MAN_HOURS_PER_MAN_YEAR
#	),
#	AREA(economic_multiplier)
#)
#
# but now modeled as a fraction of the other categories:

- unit = man_years

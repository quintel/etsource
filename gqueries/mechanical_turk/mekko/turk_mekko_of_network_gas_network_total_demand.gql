# This query takes the demand side of network gas.
# The carrier gas_power_fuelmix can't be queried robustly since this carrier is mixed with crude oil.
# This crude oil is not in the network gas demand calculations.
# Losses to energy_treatment_natural_gas_loss and energy_distribution_network_gas_loss are accounted
# for in the time_resolved query

# This calculates the biogenic share of the crude oil final demand node only.
# It does not include bionaphtha, which is tracked separately in
# final_demand_of_biomass_products_in_industry_energetic.
#
# The biogenic share covers only: biodiesel, bio_kerosene, and bio_oil inputs
# to the industry_final_demand_crude_oil node.

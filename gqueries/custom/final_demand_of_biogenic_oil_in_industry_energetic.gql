# Final demand of biogenic oil and derivatives in industry (energetic use)
#
# This query uses a different approach than other sectors because naphtha is
# modeled separately in the industry sector:
# 1. Takes the demand from industry_final_demand_crude_oil and multiplies it
#    by the biogenic share (which covers biodiesel, bio_kerosene, and bio_oil)
# 2. Adds the full demand from industry_final_demand_bionaphtha (which is
#    already fully biogenic)

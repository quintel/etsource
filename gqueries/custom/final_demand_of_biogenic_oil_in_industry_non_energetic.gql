# Final demand of biogenic oil and derivatives in industry (non-energetic use)
#
# This query uses a different approach than other sectors because naphtha is
# modeled separately in the industry sector:
# 1. Takes the demand from industry_final_demand_crude_oil_non_energetic and
#    multiplies it by the biogenic share (which covers biodiesel, bio_kerosene,
#    and bio_oil)
# 2. Adds the full demand from industry_final_demand_bionaphtha_non_energetic
#    (which is already fully biogenic)

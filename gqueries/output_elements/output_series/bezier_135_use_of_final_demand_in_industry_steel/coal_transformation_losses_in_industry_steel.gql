# Returns the difference between primary coal demand and cokes/coal gas production.
# This demand is shown in the 'Energy demand of steel sector' chart to give a better impression
# of the total energy needed for the Blastfurnace production route
# Coal gas used for power plants and CHP is not included in this chart to avoid double-counting
# (e.g. we already include final demand electricity for steel)
# The transformation losses for converting coal to coal gas used in power plants/CHP is included.
# The reason for this is that coal gas can be considered a 'waste gas' of steel production, so the
# transformation losses are closely tied to the blastfurnace production route

# This query returns the climate relevant CO2-emissions of biomass which is the product
# of the primary demand for biomass times the potential CO2-emissions of this biomass times
# the percentage of this CO2-emissions that is deemed relevant for climate change as set by
# the user through a slider. We distinguish three types of biomass: solid, gas and liquid,
# which can be seperately changed by the user. The user can set different values of this slider
# for present and future.

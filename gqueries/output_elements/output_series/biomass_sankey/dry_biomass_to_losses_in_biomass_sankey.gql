# Query for Biomass Sankey diagram: connection between dry biomass and losses. The torrefaction nodes has both dry biomass and network gas (which includes greengas) as inputs. It is assumed that 100% of network_gas input is lost and that the remaining loss is dry biomass. The dry biomass losses are taken into account here, the network_gas loss is taken into account in the greengas_to_loss_in_biomass_sankey query

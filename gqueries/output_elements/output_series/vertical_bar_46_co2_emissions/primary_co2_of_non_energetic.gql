# Includes non_energetic emissions from the fertilizer industry (SMR),
# non-energetic hydrogen final demand, non-energetic ammonia final demand and
# 'delayed' emissions in molecules_other_utilisation_co2 node
# More non_energetic emissions may be added in the future
# non-energetic methanol is not (yet) included in this query. At the moment this is queried in the query primary_co2_of_industry, since the free_co2_factor of the node industry_final_demand_methanol_non_energetic is 1.0.

# Within the co2_emissions_refinery_products the node industry_final_demand_methanol_non_energetic
# is queried. This node should actually be in the query "primary_co2_of_non_energetic" and
# non-energetic nodes should be filtered out of the co2_emissions_refinery_products group for the
# energy CO2 emission queries. This is not required for now, since the
# industry_final_demand_methanol_non_energetic free_co2_factor is 1.0 and there are no other
# refinery products for which the primary CO2 emissions should be taken into account.

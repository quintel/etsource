# This is based on the energy_production_bio_oil node since for the sankey it is asssumed all oil to go in the oil mix, similar to the network gas mix.
# This is not explicitly modelled in the ETM this way, since all oil flows come together after the final demand nodes. 
# Therefore, we simply use the production node of bio oil to calculate the flows from bio oil to crude oil
